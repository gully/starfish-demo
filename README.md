# starfish-demo
A demo and performance info for [Starfish](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish)

This repo contains demos of the Starfish Spectral inference code.  I provide most of the auxiliary input and output files you need to reproduce the demos.  The motivation for this repo was largely to provide a sandbox separate from the main repository for instructive or exploratory content.  I gladly accept contributions, simply submit a pull request.

## The demos

- **demo1** An [end-to-end run](http://iancze.github.io/Starfish/current/example_wasp14.html) of Starfish on a single WASP14 spectral order.
- **demo2** An end-to-end run of Starfish on [multiple WASP14 spectral orders](http://iancze.github.io/Starfish/current/example_wasp14_multi.html).
- **demo3** Information on [jump size tuning](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues/31) with a transition probability matrix.
- **demo4** Resolution to [Starfish Issue #26](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues/26) that occurred when `sigAmp` goes negative.
- **demo5** A code snippet for how to [save intermediate results]([Starfish/#40](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues/40) in long MCMC chains.
